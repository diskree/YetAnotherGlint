The vanilla's enchanted items glint texture seems too noisy for me, so why not fix that?

## How?

This resource pack changes the glint texture of enchanted items and equipped armor to a minimalistic texture with lines instead of noise. This creates a "striped" glint effect.

## Configure

This resource pack has [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts) mod support! You can separately adjust the glint of both items and equipped armor. There are 7 texture options in choose. It is also possible to turn off the glint.

This is similar to Unobtrusive Enchantment Glint from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), but better.
